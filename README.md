# LaTeX Expression

The *LaTex Expression* is a python module for easy LaTeX typesetting of algebraic
expressions in symbolic form with automatic substitution and result computation.

It was originally written by [Jan Stransky](https://mech.fsv.cvut.cz/~stransky)
from Czech Technical University, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Department of
Structural Mechanics, but the latest update was done in 2015.

It was updated and posted by Jakub Kaderka in 2022 at the forked repo.

This fork has been tuned for a specific application of displaying engineering calculations.
